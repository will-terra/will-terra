Fullstack Engineer with 2 years of experience building scalable, high-quality web applications using Ruby on Rails, React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and Next.js. Contributed to an international Yamaha USA project, working in an English-speaking environment to deliver optimized UI/UX solutions. Passionate about clean, maintainable code and improving web performance.

Previously worked as a Chef, where I developed strong adaptability, attention to detail, and the ability to thrive under pressure â€” all of which I now bring into the tech world through efficient planning and teamwork.

I'm now seeking opportunities where I can combine technical skills with critical thinking and problem-solving to contribute to innovative, collaborative projects.
