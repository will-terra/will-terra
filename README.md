## Hello, my name is William!

 I am a Full Stack Engineer with 2 years of experience building scalable, high-quality web applications using Ruby on Rails, React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and Next.js. I am passionate about clean, maintainable code and enhancing web performance. My previous experience as a Chef honed my adaptability, attention to detail, and ability to thrive under pressure — skills I now apply in the tech world through efficient planning and teamwork.

🔭 I've contributed to an international project with Yamaha USA, working in an English-speaking environment to deliver optimized UI/UX solutions.

💬 I am currently seeking opportunities where I can combine my technical skills with critical thinking and problem-solving to contribute to innovative, collaborative projects.
